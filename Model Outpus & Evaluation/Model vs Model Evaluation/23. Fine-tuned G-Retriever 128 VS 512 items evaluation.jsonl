However, the assistants' answers also introduce additional steps and packages (PyQt5 and PyQt5-console) that are not present in the correct answer. Both assistants have hallucinations. Assistant A's answer is worse because it introduces hallucinations and does not provide a direct match with the correct answer. Assistant B's answer is worse because it introduces hallucinations and also requires additional steps to install the required packages.
