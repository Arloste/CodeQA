{"explanation": "Assistant B provided the correct information about the limitations of the Spyder IDE's Git repository access, while Assistant A failed to do so. However, both assistants provided similar answers to the user question. The key points in the correct answer are that the Spyder IDE Git repository does not have access to the internal workings of the repository. Both assistants' answers have an exact match with the correct solution's key points, which is that the Spyder IDE Git repository does not have the information needed to answer the question.
